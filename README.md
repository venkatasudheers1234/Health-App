# Nutrition Generative AI Doctor using Gemini AI Pro

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Nutrition Generative AI Doctor** is a cutting-edge application that uses **Generative AI** and **Computer Vision** to analyze food images and estimate their caloric content. The app provides a detailed breakdown of each food item's nutritional value, helping users‚Äîsuch as nutritionists, dietitians, and health-conscious individuals‚Äîmake informed dietary decisions. 

The project leverages **Google Gemini Pro Vision API** to automate the nutritional analysis process by recognizing food items from images and generating their caloric values.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to provide an automated solution for nutritional analysis using advanced AI techniques, including:

- **Calorie Estimation**: Calculate the total calories in a meal based on the uploaded image.
- **Detailed Nutritional Breakdown**: Provide a breakdown of calories and other nutritional values for each food item in the image.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Build an easy-to-use, interactive web application with **Streamlit**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

The project integrates several powerful tools and technologies to deliver its functionality:

- **Python**: Backend programming for API integration and logic.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
- **Google Gemini Pro Vision API**: Used for analyzing food images and generating detailed content.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for image processing (e.g., handling file uploads).
- **dotenv**: For securely managing API keys and environment variables.
- **Google Generative AI**: For content generation based on image analysis.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Food Image Upload**: Users can upload images of their meals to get nutritional data.
- **Calorie Breakdown**: Provides the total calories and detailed breakdown for each food item.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built using Streamlit, making it easy to use for non-technical users.

üíª How It Works

User uploads an image: The app allows users to upload an image of their food.
Image processing: The uploaded image is passed through the Google Gemini Pro Vision API, which analyzes the content of the food items in the image.
Generative AI generates nutritional information: Based on the image, the app provides a breakdown of each food item, including the number of calories and other nutritional values.

üôã Key Responsibilities & Contributions
Data Collection: Gathered and cleaned datasets of food images and their nutritional information.
Model Training: Fine-tuned the Gemini AI Pro model to recognize and classify food items from images.
Backend Development: Integrated the Google Gemini Pro API and Streamlit to build the app.
Performance: Achieved a high 91% accuracy in providing accurate nutritional data.

## Results & Accuracy
The Nutrition Generative AI Doctor achieves an impressive 91% accuracy in estimating the caloric content and nutritional breakdown of food from images.
The app's accuracy is based on food images and their corresponding nutritional values collected and trained within the Gemini AI Pro model.

üöÄ Future Enhancements
Broader Database: Include a larger variety of food items to improve the model‚Äôs accuracy across diverse cuisines.
User Profiles: Allow users to save their dietary history and track progress over time.
Cross-Platform Integration: Integrate with health apps, wearables, or food tracking platforms to provide more personalized recommendations.
